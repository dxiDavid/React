## My process

Same as always. I began with analyzing the design only this time I did it thinking about components instead of just divs

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned how to make reusable components, granted the data being passed to them is hard coded.

### Continued development

I'll come back and change the hard coded values for the props once I learn how to make API calls.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This is where I found the best tutorials and explanations (For me) on CSS concepts and      writing functional CSS. Kevin Powel really knows his stuff and gives concise explanations.
- [w3schools](https://w3schools.com) - This website has an entire course on JavaScript with simple examples for both basic and advanced concepts.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website provides very well written explanations to CSS concepts as well as examples for when you need to revisit a concept.
- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Always helpful to read the documentation of any language.
