## Overview

This is a fairly simple project with functionality that was not too challenging for a React beginner (At the time of writing this). At this poit in time if you want to view it you'll have to clone it into your local environment and install the necessary modules.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started by making all the relevant data to render, did most of the styling, added some functionality adn made it responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

1. I learned how to use the ternary - ```condition ? content : other content ``` - and the ```&&``` operator for conditional rendering.
2. I also learned how to use the ```{ useState }``` hook in react to save state and update the UI.
<br>
3. I cemented my knowledge of the ```.map()``` method to render data from a file (or JSON from an API call).

### Continued development

1. I'll change the data from a local file to a JSON file. 
2. I'll also add some animations to make the UX more fun.
3. Optimize the code where necessary

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This is where I found the best tutorials and explanations (For me) on CSS concepts and      writing functional CSS. Kevin Powel really knows his stuff and gives concise explanations.
- [w3schools](https://w3schools.com) - This website has an entire course on JavaScript with simple examples for both basic and advanced concepts.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website provides very well written explanations to CSS concepts as well as examples for when you need to revisit a concept.
- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Always helpful to read the documentation of any language.
