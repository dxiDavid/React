## Overview

Thos challenge forced me to learn a lot of new concepts to get it to work. I enjoyed building it with ``CSS Grid`` since I'm now getting more comfortable using it. The layout would have been very difficult to do with ``Flexbox``

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## My process

I started by identifying any reusable components, made a data file then mapped that data to those components. The components were all in the parent component as ``JSX`` elements first to make sure everything rendered correctly then I moved each component to a separate file and passed the ``.map()`` function parameters as props.

<br/>
After The styling was done, I added the dark mode toggle functionaliy and some animations to make it more interesting

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

1. I learned how to use ``grid-template-areas`` to move elements around the page

2. I learned how to use CSS custom properties to add the dark mode feature to the page

3. I learned about the context API though I didn't use it since this was a simple project


### Continued development

I don't quite know what else to do. Maybe comeback and optimize the code?
